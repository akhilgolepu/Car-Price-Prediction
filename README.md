# Car Price Prediction
Developed an end-to-end machine learning web application to predict the resale value of a used car based on parameters such as vehicle age, mileage, engine capacity, power, number of seats, and categorical features like fuel type, seller type, and transmission type.  The model was trained on a real-world dataset from CarDekho using Streamlit and a little bit of CSS.
